# Loading States Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive loading states and user feedback system implemented for the unified booking platform.

## Overview

The loading states implementation provides consistent user feedback across all interactions, ensuring users always understand what the system is doing and receive appropriate feedback for their actions.

- Consistent styling across the application
- Accessible with proper ARIA attributes

#### LoadingButton
- Button component with built-in loading states
- Prevents multiple submissions during loading
- Shows loading text and spinner
- Maintains button styling and variants

#### FormLoadingOverlay
- Overlay that covers forms during submission
- Prevents user interaction while processing
- Shows loading message and spinner
- Maintains form visibility underneath

#### LoadingState
- Context-aware loading states for different operations
- Icons and messages specific to operation type (search, booking, dashboard, etc.)
- Consistent styling and behavior

#### Skeleton Components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Loading Button
```tsx
import { LoadingButton } from '@/components/ui/loading';

function MyForm() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      await submitForm();
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <LoadingButton
      loading={loading}
      loadingText="Submitting..."
      onClick={handleSubmit}
    >
      Submit Form
    </LoadingButton>
  );
}
```

### Form with Loading Overlay
```tsx
import { FormLoadingOverlay } from '@/components/ui/loading';

function MyForm() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  return (
    <FormLoadingOverlay isLoading={loading} message="Saving changes...">
      <form>
        {/* Form content */}
      </form>
    </FormLoadingOverlay>
  );
}
```

### Data Fetching with Loading States
```tsx
import { useDataFetching } from '@/hooks/useLoadingState';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error, fetchData, retry } = useDataFetching();

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData(
      () => fetch('/api/data').then(res => res.json()),
      {
        onSuccess: (data) => console.log('Data loaded:', data),
        onError: (error) => console.error('Failed to load:', error),
      }
    );
  }, [fetchData]);

  if (isLoading) return <LoadingState type="general" />;
  if (error) return <ErrorState error={error} onRetry={retry} />;
  
  return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>;
}
```

### User Feedback
```tsx
import { useUserFeedback } from '@/hooks/useUserFeedback';

function MyComponent() {
  const feedback = useUserFeedback();

  const handleAction = async () => {
    await feedback.executeWithFeedback(
      () => performAction(),
      {
        loadingMessage: 'Processing...',
        successMessage: 'Action completed successfully!',
        errorMessage: 'Failed to complete action',
      }
    );
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleAction}>
      Perform Action
    </button>
  );
}
```
