# Mock Data Cleanup Summary

## Task 10: Remove hardcoded mock data and ensure real data usage

This document summarizes the changes made to remove all hardcoded mock data and ensure the application uses real data from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. SearchBar Component (`src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx`)

**Issue**: Hardcoded fallback location data
```typescript
// REMOVED: Hardcoded Tunisian cities fallback
const fallbackLocations: LocationSuggestion[] = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Tunis', type: 'city' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Sfax', type: 'city' },
  // ... more hardcoded cities
];
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed hardcoded fallback data
- Now fails gracefully when API is unavailable (shows empty suggestions instead of fallback)
- Created new API endpoint `/api/search/locations` to provide real location suggestions from database

### 2. FilterPanel Component (`src/components/search/FilterPanel.tsx`)

**Issue**: Hardcoded city buttons and location suggestions
```typescript
// REMOVED: Hardcoded city array
{['Tunis', 'Sfax', 'Sousse', 'Monastir', 'Bizerte'].map(city => (...))}

// REMOVED: Hardcoded "Near Tunis" button
onClick={() => handleLocationChange('Tunis')}
```

**Solution**:
- Added state for `popularLocations` and `locationsLoading`
- Created API call to `/api/search/popular-locations` to fetch real popular locations
- Dynamic city buttons now use database-derived popular locations
- "Near [City]" button now uses the most popular location from database

### 3. Provider Availability Page (`src/app/provider/availability/page.tsx`)

**Issue**: Hardcoded day names array
```typescript
// REPLACED: Hardcoded day names
const dayNames = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
```

**Solution**:
- Used `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to get localized day names dynamically
- Now supports internationalization and different locales

### 4. Invoice Generation (`src/app/api/orders/[id]/invoice/route.ts`)

**Issue**: Hardcoded company information
```typescript
// REPLACED: Hardcoded company data
company: {
  name: 'Mounasabet Event Services',
  address: '123 Business Street',
  city: 'Tunis',
  // ...
}
```

**Solution**:
- Now uses environment variables for all company information
- Supports configuration through `.env` files
- Fallbacks to minimal defaults if env vars not set

## New API Endpoints Created

### 1. `/api/search/locations` (GET)
- Provides location suggestions based on query parameter
- Sources data from services and providers in database
- Returns unique locations that match the search query
- No hardcoded fallback data

### 2. `/api/search/popular-locations` (GET)
- Returns most popular locations based on service/provider counts
- Aggregates data from both services and providers tables
- Ranks locations by frequency of use
- Used for quick location selection in filters

## Environment Variables Added

The following environment variables should be configured for production:

```env
# Company Information (for invoices and legal documents)
COMPANY_NAME="Your Company Name"
COMPANY_ADDRESS="Your Business Address"
COMPANY_CITY="Your City"
COMPANY_COUNTRY="Your Country"
COMPANY_EMAIL="billing@yourcompany.com"
COMPANY_PHONE="Your Phone Number"
COMPANY_TAX_ID="Your Tax ID"
```

## Testing

### New Test Suite: `production-data-validation.test.ts`

Created comprehensive tests to ensure:
1. No hardcoded mock data patterns in production code
2. Company information uses environment variables
3. No fallback to hardcoded location data
4. Empty states handled without placeholder data
5. Search results come from database queries

All tests pass, confirming successful cleanup.

## Impact on User Experience

### Before
- Location suggestions fell back to hardcoded Tunisian cities
- Filter panel showed fixed set of cities regardless of actual data
- Company information was hardcoded in invoices
- Day names were hardcoded in English

### After
- Location suggestions come from actual service/provider locations in database
- Filter panel shows popular locations based on real usage data
- Company information is configurable via environment variables
- Day names are localized and dynamic
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail (empty states instead of fake data)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **7.1**: Audited all components for hardcoded arrays and mock data
✅ **7.2**: Removed fallback to mock data in error scenarios  
✅ **7.3**: Ensured all search results come from database queries
✅ **7.4**: Verified empty states are handled without placeholder data

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx` - Removed hardcoded location fallback
2. `src/components/search/FilterPanel.tsx` - Dynamic popular locations
3. `src/app/provider/availability/page.tsx` - Localized day names
4. `src/app/api/orders/[id]/invoice/route.ts` - Environment-based company info

## Files Created

1. `src/app/api/search/locations/route.ts` - Location suggestions API
2. `src/app/api/search/popular-locations/route.ts` - Popular locations API
3. `src/__tests__/production-data-validation.test.ts` - Validation tests
4. `MOCK_DATA_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

1. Configure environment variables in production deployment
2. Seed database with initial location data if needed
3. Monitor API performance for location suggestions
4. Consider caching popular locations for better performance

The application now uses real data exclusively and handles empty states gracefully without falling back to hardcoded mock data.
