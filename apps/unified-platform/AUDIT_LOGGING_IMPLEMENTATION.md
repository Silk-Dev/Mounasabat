# Audit Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive audit logging for administrative actions in the unified booking platform. The audit logging system tracks all sensitive operations, administrative actions, and security events to ensure accountability and compliance.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

**New Table: `audit_logs`**
- Stores all audit log entries with comprehensive metadata
- Includes foreign key relationships to users
- Optimized with indexes for efficient querying
- Supports JSON metadata for flexible data storage

**Key Fields:**
- `id`, `timestamp`, `level`, `eventType`
- `userId`, `userRole`, `targetUserId`
- `targetResourceId`, `targetResourceType`
- `action`, `description`, `metadata`
- `ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `sessionId`
- `success`, `errorMessage`, `requestId`

### 2. Enhanced Audit Logger Service

**Location:** `src/lib/audit-logger.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Database persistence with fallback to memory/console logging
- Structured logging with consistent format
- Support for multiple audit event types and levels
- Helper methods for common audit scenarios
- Statistics and reporting capabilities

**Event Types Supported:**
- Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- User management (create, update, delete, suspend)
- Provider management (approve, reject, suspend, verify)
- Service management (create, update, delete, approve)
- Booking events (create, update, cancel, complete)
- Payment events (process, fail, refund)
- Security events (violations, unauthorized access)
- Admin actions (all administrative operations)

### 3. Admin API Routes with Audit Logging

**Enhanced Routes:**
- `/api/admin/users/[id]` - User management actions
- `/api/admin/providers/[id]` - Provider management actions
- `/api/admin/reviews/[id]` - Review moderation actions
- `/api/admin/reviews` - Bulk review actions
- `/api/admin/issues/[id]` - Issue management actions

**Audit Events Logged:**
- User profile updates and role changes
- User banning and suspension actions
- Provider verification and approval
- Provider rejection and suspension
- Review deletion and moderation
- Bulk review operations
- Issue status updates and assignments
- Unauthorized access attempts
- System errors and failures

### 4. Admin Panel Audit Logs Interface

**Location:** `src/app/admin/audit-logs/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Real-time audit log viewing with pagination
- Advanced filtering by user, event type, level, date range
- Statistics dashboard showing key metrics
- Export functionality for compliance reporting
- Detailed event information with metadata
- Color-coded severity levels
- Search and sorting capabilities

**Statistics Displayed:**
- Total events count
- Failure rate percentage
- Critical and error event counts
- Event distribution by type and level
- Top users by activity

### 5. Navigation Integration

**Updated:** `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- Added "Audit Logs" navigation item in admin panel
- Accessible to admin users only
- Integrated with existing admin navigation structure

## Audit Events Coverage

- ✅ User banning and suspension
- ✅ Account activation/deactivation
- ✅ Unauthorized access attempts

### Provider Management
- ✅ Provider verification approval
- ✅ Provider verification rejection
- ✅ Provider suspension
- ✅ Provider profile updates
- ✅ Service approval/rejection

### Content Moderation
- ✅ Review deletion (individual)
- ✅ Review verification/unverification

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Uses Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- Automatic fallback to memory/console logging if database fails
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Support for complex filtering and aggregation

### Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous logging to avoid blocking main application flow
- Efficient database queries with pagination
- Memory management for fallback logging
- Optimized indexes for common query patterns

### Security Features
- Sensitive data sanitization in error messages
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Session correlation for security analysis
- Request ID tracking for debugging

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when audit logging fails
- Comprehensive error logging with context
- Fallback mechanisms for system reliability
- Non-blocking audit operations

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `src/__tests__/audit-logger.test.ts` - Core audit logger functionality
- `src/__tests__/admin-audit-integration.test.ts` - Admin action integration tests

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Basic audit logging operations
- ✅ Admin action logging
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Statistics generation
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ Filter and query operations

## Usage Examples

### Logging Admin Actions
```typescript
await auditLogger.logAdminAction(
  adminUserId,
  'update_user',
  'user',
  targetUserId,
  true,
  request,
  { changes: ['role: customer → admin'] }
);
```

### Logging Security Events
```typescript
await auditLogger.logSecurityEvent(
  AuditEventType.unauthorized_access,
  'Unauthorized admin panel access attempt',
  request,
  userId
);
```

### Retrieving Audit Logs
```typescript
const logs = await auditLogger.getLogs({
  eventType: AuditEventType.admin_action,
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date(),
  limit: 100
});
```
