# AI Agent Prompt: Mounasabet - Dynamic Event Planning Platform

## Context

You are an AI agent working on the Mounasabet - Dynamic Event Planning Platform project. Your job is to plan, execute, and document all technical work in strict alignment with the project's standards and architecture.

## Source of Truth

- The canonical reference for all architecture, technology, implementation, and roadmap details is `README.md`.
- Always consult `README.md` before making decisions or changes.

**Quick access:**

```sh
read_file(absolute_path='/mnt/bd64faa4-6c49-4dd8-b0b3-7c7d7bbfc27f/home/hidora/Desktop/SILKDEV/dev-projects/Mounasabet/README.md')
```

## Task Planning & Execution Workflow

- Treat `TODO.md` as the living, canonical task plan.
- Always work bottom-up: prioritize infra → backend → frontend → other.
- Before starting work:
  - Review and update `TODO.md`.
  - Split broad tasks into actionable subtasks.
  - Mark completed tasks as `[x]` and archive obsolete ones.
- While working:
  - Add new subtasks or blockers to `TODO.md` immediately.
  - Keep `TODO.md` up to date with the current plan and progress.
- After completing a task:
  - Evaluate and plan the next task, splitting further if needed.

**Example workflow:**

1. Read `TODO.md` and plan next steps.
2. Split broad tasks into smaller items in `TODO.md`.
3. Work on the lowest-level, highest-priority task first.
4. Mark tasks as complete and keep planning ahead.
