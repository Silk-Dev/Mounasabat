# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for making the unified booking platform truly production-ready by removing all placeholder code, incomplete implementations, debugging statements, and ensuring all features are fully functional. The platform currently has several areas that need to be completed or cleaned up before it can be deployed to production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all debugging and development code removed from the production codebase, so that the application runs efficiently and securely in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL NOT contain any console.log, console.warn, or console.error statements except for critical error logging
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged through a proper logging service instead of console statements
3. WHEN the application encounters issues THEN it SHALL NOT display alert() dialogs to users
4. WHEN debugging code exists THEN it SHALL be removed or replaced with proper production logging
5. IF development-only code exists THEN it SHALL be removed or conditionally excluded in production builds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all features to be fully implemented without placeholder messages, so that I can use the complete functionality of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests an invoice PDF THEN the system SHALL generate and return a proper PDF document
2. WHEN a user accesses any feature THEN they SHALL NOT see "not yet implemented" or "coming soon" messages
3. WHEN a user interacts with the platform THEN all functionality SHALL be complete and working
4. WHEN a feature is accessed THEN it SHALL provide the expected functionality without placeholder responses
5. IF a feature cannot be completed THEN it SHALL be removed from the user interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the application, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved efficiently in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in API routes THEN they SHALL be logged using a structured logging system
2. WHEN client-side errors occur THEN they SHALL be captured and reported to an error monitoring service
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the errors SHALL be properly handled and logged with context
4. WHEN external service calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN administrators SHALL be notified through appropriate channels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper user feedback mechanisms instead of browser alerts, so that I have a professional and consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations succeed or fail THEN users SHALL receive feedback through toast notifications or inline messages
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN users SHALL see proper loading states and success/error feedback
3. WHEN availability is updated THEN providers SHALL receive confirmation through the UI components
4. WHEN actions are performed THEN the feedback SHALL be consistent with the application's design system
5. IF browser alerts exist THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper UI components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want complete invoice and document generation functionality, so that I can provide proper documentation to customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer requests an invoice THEN the system SHALL generate a PDF with all booking details
2. WHEN invoices are generated THEN they SHALL include proper formatting, branding, and legal information
3. WHEN documents are created THEN they SHALL be stored securely and be retrievable
4. WHEN PDF generation occurs THEN it SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback options
5. WHEN invoices are accessed THEN they SHALL be properly authenticated and authorized

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and health checks, so that I can ensure the platform operates reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN health check endpoints SHALL provide accurate status information
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN they SHALL be detected and reported through monitoring systems
3. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issues
4. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded values and mock data removed from the production code, so that the application works with real data in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded mock data arrays
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL come from the database without fallback to mock data
3. WHEN empty states occur THEN they SHALL be handled properly without showing placeholder data
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL not contain hardcoded example data
5. IF mock data exists THEN it SHALL only be present in test files and development seeds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI components to provide proper feedback and loading states, so that I understand what the system is doing at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is loading THEN users SHALL see appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN operations are in progress THEN users SHALL see progress feedback
3. WHEN forms are being submitted THEN submit buttons SHALL show loading states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN users SHALL see clear error messages with recovery options
5. WHEN operations complete THEN users SHALL receive confirmation of the results

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper security measures implemented throughout the application, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN they SHALL be properly authenticated and authorized
2. WHEN user input is processed THEN it SHALL be validated and sanitized
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL implement proper rate limiting
4. WHEN errors occur THEN sensitive information SHALL NOT be exposed in error messages
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN all administrative actions SHALL be logged

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want comprehensive testing coverage for all production code, so that I can be confident in the system's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed THEN it SHALL have comprehensive unit test coverage
2. WHEN features are implemented THEN they SHALL have integration tests
3. WHEN user workflows exist THEN they SHALL have end-to-end tests
4. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL have proper API tests
5. WHEN critical paths are identified THEN they SHALL have performance tests
