# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The unified platform currently contains hardcoded mock data throughout various components and pages, which prevents users from seeing real, accurate data from the database. This feature will systematically identify and replace all mock data with proper database queries and API calls to ensure every view displays authentic, up-to-date information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to see real data from the database in all views, so that I can make informed decisions based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the system SHALL display only data fetched from the database or external APIs
2. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the system SHALL return actual services and providers from the database
3. WHEN a user views provider information THEN the system SHALL show real provider data, ratings, and reviews
4. WHEN a user views booking information THEN the system SHALL display actual booking records and statuses
5. WHEN a user views dashboard metrics THEN the system SHALL show real-time data calculated from actual database records

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all mock data removed from production code, so that the application reflects the true state of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no hardcoded arrays of mock services, providers, or bookings in production components
2. WHEN examining search functionality THEN the system SHALL not fall back to mock data when database queries are available
3. WHEN inspecting API responses THEN all endpoints SHALL return data from the database or appropriate external services
4. WHEN checking component props THEN no components SHALL receive hardcoded mock objects as default values
5. WHEN analyzing data flows THEN all data SHALL originate from legitimate data sources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want accurate analytics and reporting, so that I can monitor platform performance and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing admin dashboards THEN all metrics SHALL be calculated from real database data
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL use actual transaction and booking data
3. WHEN monitoring platform health THEN all statistics SHALL reflect true system usage
4. WHEN analyzing user behavior THEN the data SHALL come from actual user interactions
5. WHEN tracking provider performance THEN ratings and reviews SHALL be from real customer feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to see my actual business data, so that I can manage my services and bookings effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider views their dashboard THEN all booking data SHALL be from their actual bookings
2. WHEN a provider checks their services THEN the system SHALL display their real service offerings
3. WHEN a provider views reviews THEN only authentic customer reviews SHALL be shown
4. WHEN a provider checks earnings THEN the amounts SHALL reflect actual payments received
5. WHEN a provider views analytics THEN all metrics SHALL be calculated from their real business data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to see authentic service listings and provider information, so that I can make informed booking decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer searches for services THEN only real, available services SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN a customer views provider profiles THEN all information SHALL be authentic and current
3. WHEN a customer reads reviews THEN only genuine customer feedback SHALL be shown
4. WHEN a customer checks availability THEN the system SHALL reflect actual provider schedules
5. WHEN a customer views pricing THEN all amounts SHALL be the real prices set by providers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want proper error handling for missing data, so that the application gracefully handles empty states without showing mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no real data is available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty states
2. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL show error messages instead of falling back to mock data
3. WHEN API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL indicate loading or error states
4. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
5. WHEN search returns no results THEN the system SHALL display "no results found" messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify that all data is authentic, so that I can ensure the platform's integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing any feature THEN no hardcoded mock data SHALL be present in the user interface
2. WHEN verifying data consistency THEN all displayed information SHALL match database records
3. WHEN checking data freshness THEN all information SHALL be current and not cached indefinitely
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle empty or missing data appropriately
5. WHEN validating user flows THEN all data interactions SHALL use real database operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the platform, I want proper database seeding scripts, so that I can initialize the platform with essential data and optionally add demo data for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the initial database setup THEN the system SHALL have a base seed script that creates essential platform data
2. WHEN the base seed runs THEN it SHALL create necessary categories, system settings, and administrative accounts
3. WHEN developers need demo data THEN there SHALL be a separate demo seed script available
4. WHEN the demo seed runs THEN it SHALL populate the database with realistic sample providers, services, and bookings
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN only the base seed SHALL run, not the demo data seed
6. WHEN running in development THEN developers SHALL have the option to run either or both seed scripts
7. WHEN the platform starts with no data THEN it SHALL function properly with empty states rather than showing mock data
